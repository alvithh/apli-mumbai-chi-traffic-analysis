Traffic congestion and air quality analysis for Mumbai using Python, SQL, Prophet, and Power BI
# Apli Mumbai Chi Traffic Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Mumbai’s traffic congestion and air quality data to identify peak congestion hours, traffic trends, and the relationship between traffic speed and AQI. The project also includes short-term traffic forecasting to support smarter travel decisions.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Prophet (Time Series Forecasting)
- Power BI (Dashboarding)

## Key Objectives
- Clean and preprocess traffic and AQI data
- Analyze congestion patterns across time and locations
- Identify correlation between traffic speed and air quality
- Forecast traffic speed for the next 24 hours
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

## Key Insights
- Peak congestion observed during morning and evening office hours
- Traffic speed shows a negative correlation with AQI levels
- Forecasting model highlights expected low-speed intervals for better route planning

## Files in this Repository
- notebooks/ – Python analysis and forecasting notebooks
- sql/ – SQL queries used for traffic trend analysis
- dashboard/ – Power BI dashboard file
- data/ – Raw and cleaned datasets

## Outcome
The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow including data cleaning, SQL analysis, time series forecasting, and business-focused visualization.
